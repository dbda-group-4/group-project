* 7.Make a Jenkinsfile in repository.
* 8.Make a pipeline job in jenkins to build Jenkinfile and deploy it.

### Execution:
* 1.Make a json file in repository containig the CFT code of AWS services and make Jenkinfile refer it as template-body. 
* 2.Commit the changes in repository.
* 3.Build a jenkins job and give the parameters for it.
* 4.It will automatically compile, validate ,unit test and if successfully build it deploys the CFT stack in AWS.
* 5.Now once the CFT succeesfully complited you are ready to use requested service.

### Output
