# Develop a CI/CD pipeline to deploy any application using Jenkins, Python, Shell Script on Cloud.

### Automation of creation and deployment of S3,AWS and Lambda on AWS using Jenkins Pipeline.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you setup Automated Cloud Services on Amazon Web Services.

### Prerequisites
* AWS Account
* Knowledge of Shell Script
* Knowledge of Python
* Jenkins

* Get the password of jenkins from /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword path from EC2.
* Click on "Install Suggested Plugins" and continue further steps for Jenkins Server to start.
* Make a Repository in Git account and make a "Webhook" for the same.
* Make a Jenkinsfile in repository.
* Make a pipeline job in jenkins to build Jenkinfile and deploy it.

### Execution:
* Make a json file in repository containig the CFT code of AWS services and make Jenkinfile refer it as template-body. 
* Commit the changes in repository.
* Build a jenkins job and give the parameters for it.
* It will automatically compile, validate ,unit test and if successfully build it deploys the CFT stack in AWS.
* Now once the CFT succeesfully complited you are ready to use requested service.

### Output

* You have succesfully created the requested AWS service through Jenkins Pipeline.
